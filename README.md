This web application was developed by me in 2023 as a free to use piece of software.  At the time of writing it is hosted live
at www.openwindows.uk. 


It allows users to estimate noise levels inside a room caused by noise breaking into the room from outside. 
As these internal noise levels are dependent on the type and the area of facade elements (particularly glazing), it 
allows users to estimate the effect that different facade elements and areas have on internal noise levels. It is of 
particular use to practicioners who wish to design rooms that comply with the design requirements and recommendations 
of the English Planning system. 

It uses (principally) Python Flask, HTML, and Javascript.
