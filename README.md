This web site allows users to estimate noise levels inside a room caused by noise breaking into the room from outside. 
As these internal noise levels are dependent on the type and the area of facade elements (particularly glazing), it 
allows users to estimate the effect that different facade elements and areas have on internal noise levels. It is of 
particular use to practicioners who wish to design rooms that comply with the design requirements and recommendations 
of the English Planning system. It was developed by me is a free to use piece of software.
