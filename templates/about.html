                        This web site allows users to estimate noise levels inside a room caused by noise breaking into the room from outside. 
                        As these internal noise levels are dependent on the type and the area of facade elements (particularly glazing), it allows 
                        users to estimate the effect that different facade elements and areas have on internal noise levels. 
                        It is of particular use to practicioners who wish to design rooms that comply with the design requirements and 
                        recommendations of the English Planning system. It was developed by Sulltech Ltd and it is a free to use piece of software.

                        It uses a database of element sound insulation assembled using information from publicly avaialable sources in particular 
                        glazing manufacturers.
                        The calculation methods used are taken from ISO 12354-3:2017 and British Standard BS 8233:2014.
