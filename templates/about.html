                        When a new dwelling is formed it is necessary to design the building envelope so that 
                        residents are not exposed to excessive noise intrusion from external noise sources which in the UK is most commonly
                        road traffic.  Since the windows are the element of a room's facade offering the least resistance to noise ingress, 
                        windows must be specified to ensure that that they resist noise adequately. Generally 
                        the two factors affecting a window's performance are the thickness of its glazing (thicker the better) 
                        and in the case of secondary or double glazing the distance of the void between the panes (the greater the better).
                        Residents will generally prefer the option of opening windows to ventilate their rooms (but also 
                        for other reasons). 
                        With a window partially open, it is the opening in the window that becomes the 
                        most significant source of noise ingress. So, when specifying the glazing one should aim to achieve satisfactory 
                        levels for residents with windows at least partially open. If satisfactory internal levels cannot be achieved 
                        by such means then the "next best" is to ventilate with trickle and wall vents, though many of them 
                        are likely to be necessary for sufficient background ventilation. If noise levels are excessive with trickle vents  
                        then designers must look to other strategies such as facade redesign, re-orientation of rooms 
                        away from noise sources or, as generally takes place in the UK, use of a mechanical ventilation system
                        to provide background ventilation to residents.

                    <p>
                        With glazing and ventilation decided one must still consider the effects of overheating on residents. 
                        The M+E team may assume that overheating be controlled by the opening of windows. However, if a room is 
                        subjected to high noise levels then opening a window to control overheating will result in the 
                        residents being exposed to excessive noise levels. The effect will be greater on south-facing fa√ßade
                        than on a north-facing one, greater on a facade facing a noise source than one shielded from a noise 
                        source and greater in south of England and London that the north. As with ventilation, physical design measures may help (reduced glazing areas, windows shutter) and again a last resort mechanical solution may be required.
                       	In many new dwellings occupants may have to make an undesirable choice between acoustic quality or indoor air quality 
                        and thermal comfort.

                        <p>
                        In January 2020,  the IOA and ANC jointly published the Acoustics Ventilation and Overheating Design Guide(AVOG). 
                        The aim of this was to provide an integrated approach to the design of new dwellings with respect to noise intrusion 
                        from external sources, the need for ventilation and the need to avoid overheating. 
                        The document proposes that in the first instance designers should specify glazing and ventilation to ensure adequate 
                        noise levels internally. The two "metrics" it refers to are the 16 hour daytime average noise level (L<sub>Aeq16hours</sub>) and 
                        the 8 hour night-time average noise level (L<sub>Aeq8hours</sub>). 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        For daytime a design target is given of L<sub>Aeq16h</sub> 35 dBA in living rooms and bedrooms and Laeq 16h 40 dBA 
                        in dining rooms. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        For night-time bedrooms a design target is given of L<sub>Aeq8hours</sub> 30 dBA and in addition the 10th highest maximum noise 
                        level Lamax should not exceed LAmax 45 dB to avoid sleep distrubance. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        These levels are generally determined by measurement survey at the location of the survey or estimated by predictive
                        modelling methods. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        For the consideration of overheating a 2 stage assessment is recommended, average noise levels are relaxed for the
                        overheating condition inside a dwelling, given that it is deemed to occur less frequently. 
                        An additonal measure for night-time maximum noise level that may be typically achieved. A single noise event above 
                        L<sub>Amax</sub> 65 dBA within a bedroom may  cause an awwakening. 
                        So, taking the above into consideration, a design team specifying glazing and determining a ventilation/overheating 
                        strategy for a bedroom will need to know what the noise level will be inside a room for their design for all 4 of 
                        those noise criteria.  And of course they may  additionally need to know what those criteria will be with the windows 
                        open, which is the "ideal" state to achieve (other factors permtting).
